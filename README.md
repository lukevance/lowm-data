This is a private-use app for generating and archiving Fantasy Football data for the League of Ordinary Working Men. This league uses Sleeper.app for annual drafting and ESPN for in-season competition tracking. This app pulls data from both those sources and has various use cases for use.

Live app available here:

## Setup

* Install Node
* 

## Archiving

In order to archive and provide backups of data, follow the steps below:

Every active roster from a completed week can be recorded by making the following request to the ESPN API:

// curl --location --request GET 'http://fantasy.espn.com/apis/v3/games/ffl/seasons/2021/segments/0/leagues/286565?view=mBoxscore&view=mMatchupScore&scoringPeriodId=18' 

Responses from the above request are titled after the  week requested: wk{number}.json



## Best Ball

For post-season analysis or just for fun. Best Ball scores for each season can be generated by the following steps. Best Ball scoring uses the results of the draft as a source for each team's roster and generates best possible scoring rosters for each week while ignoring any movement on waivers, free agency, trades, etc.
